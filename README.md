**Design your own ensemble method**

For this task you should create a markdown cell that concisely but completely describes your idea.
Following that, there should be a python implementation of your idea. 
You should run your algorithm on a real dataset and compare the performance to a random forest and some other well known ensemble approaches with default parameters (e.g. adaboost, gradient boost). 

*I want to see a nicely formatted table in which rows correspond to classifiers (yours included, at least 3 rows) and columns correspond to training and test accuracy of the models on the data.*

Then answer these questions:
* Is there reason to suppose that your approach would work better on certain types of data?
* Can you algorithm be parallelized for training or prediction?

Your algorithm should be fundamentally different from the algorithms we have seen, but could be a tweak or combination of those existing ideas. 

Motivating thoughts:

* Can you think of a novel way to enhance ensemble diversity of opinion?
* Can you think of a novel way for models to iteratively correct the mistakes of the previous models (as in boosting)?

As always this assignment is partly a test of your ability to **communicate**. Write the appropriate amount of prose (not too much, not too little) and strive for clarity. Provide tables and visualizations where appropriate.
